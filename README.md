## Task 2: Linux Kernel
The Linux Kernel is the main component of a Linux operating system. It acts as an interface between computer's hardware and applications. Linux Kernel controls Memory Management, Process Manageement, Device Drivers and System calls.

## Task 3: Difference between 32bit and 64bit computers
A 32-bit system accesses 2^32 memory addresses i.e 4GB of RAM whereas 64-bit system accesses 2^64 memory addresses which handles more than 4GB of RAM easily. For 32-bit, it can access memory of maximum 4,294,967,296 bytes and for 64-bit, it can access memory of maximum 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes.

## Task 4: What is Git
Git is an open-source control system used to handle all sized projects. Using Git, changes done in a project can be easily tracked

## Task 6: Low-level language and High-level language
Low-level language contains instructions that are understandable by a computer. eg: assembly language. High-level language contains software programs and scripts. eg: PHP

## Task 7: Object in OOP
An object is an instance of a class and an abstract datatype with some characteristics. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated that is, an object is created, memory is allocated.
```
class employee 
{ 
    char name[20]; 
    int id; 
public: 
    void getdetails(){} 
}; 
  
int main() 
{ 
   employee e1; // e1 is a object  
} 
```
